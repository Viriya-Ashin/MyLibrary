        <p>## Biography
            <br>
            ### Tejobhasa
            <br>
            I am Tejobhasa, originally from Myanmar, born to U Kyaw Ngwe and Daw Mar Mar Aye. I have one sister and one brother. From an early age, I embraced monastic life, becoming a Buddhist monk in my childhood, which profoundly shaped my educational and spiritual journey.
            <br>
            My foundational education was rooted in the traditional Buddhist monastic system. I rigorously pursued and successfully passed the Pathamange, Pathamalat, and Pathamagyi examinations in Katha city, Sagaing Division. These examinations are critical milestones in the monastic educational curriculum, reflecting a deep understanding of Buddhist scriptures, ethical conduct, and philosophical tenets.
            <br>
            To further my monastic and academic training, I studied for two years at the New Masoeyein Monastery in Mandalay city, where I pursued the Dhammacariya degree. This advanced program is designed for monks who aspire to become teachers of the Dhamma, equipping them with comprehensive knowledge and practical teaching skills in Buddhist studies.
            <br>
            Recognizing the importance of English for accessing a broader spectrum of scholarly resources and engaging with the global community, I relocated to Yangon. There, I dedicated two years to mastering the English language. This linguistic proficiency has been pivotal in my subsequent academic pursuits and research activities.
            <br>
            My academic journey led me to Sri Lanka, a renowned hub for Buddhist studies. I pursued advanced degrees, earning a Master of Arts and a Doctor of Philosophy in Buddhist Studies. These academic achievements reflect my deep and sustained engagement with Buddhist philosophy, history, and practice, and they have enabled me to contribute significantly to both academic scholarship and the dissemination of Buddhist teachings.
            <br>
            Currently, I reside in Taiwan, where I am studying the Chinese language to broaden my linguistic and cultural competencies. This endeavor is part of my continuous commitment to personal and professional growth.
            <br>
            In addition to my studies, I am deeply committed to sharing my Dhamma knowledge with laypeople. This involves teaching and guiding others in the principles and practices of Buddhism, which I find profoundly fulfilling. My service to the community through the dissemination of Dhamma is a source of great pride and satisfaction.
            <br>
            Balancing rigorous academic training with practical monastic discipline, I aim to bridge the gap between scholarly study and the practical application of Buddhist teachings. My ultimate goal is to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of Buddhism in various contexts, contributing positively to both academic discourse and spiritual practice.</p>
