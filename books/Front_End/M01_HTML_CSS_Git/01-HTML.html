      <p>## Biography
        <br>
        ### Tejobhasa
        <br>
        I am Tejobhasa, a dedicated learner and educator based in Yangon and Colombo. My journey is marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a deep-seated passion for teaching. Currently, I am immersed in the study of full-stack web development and the Chinese language, under the guidance of my esteemed instructors. These fields represent the forefront of technological advancement and cultural understanding, and I am committed to mastering them to enhance my professional capabilities.
        <br>
        In addition to my technical and linguistic studies, I actively engage in sharing my profound understanding of Buddhism with laypeople. This endeavor not only enriches the spiritual lives of others but also allows me to deepen my own insights and practice. Teaching Buddhism is a fulfilling way to contribute to my community, fostering a greater appreciation for its principles and practices.
        <br>
        My culinary interests include a fondness for traditional dishes such as rice and curry, and I also enjoy Japanese noodles. These preferences reflect a broader appreciation for cultural diversity and the simple pleasures of life.
        <br>
        Reflecting on my journey, I often contemplate the broader significance of my pursuits. Over the past two decades, I have dedicated myself to continuous learning. However, I recognize that knowledge acquisition, while essential, is not sufficient in itself. This insight has motivated me to channel my efforts towards becoming a professional educator, with the aim of making a tangible difference in the lives of others.
        <br>
        To this end, I am committed to honing my teaching skills and developing a pedagogical approach that is both effective and compassionate. My goal is to inspire and empower my students, equipping them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in their own endeavors. Through this process, I strive to contribute positively to society, embodying the principles of lifelong learning and service to others.</p>
